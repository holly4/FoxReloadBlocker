<title>Fox Reload Blocker Version 1.1</title>

<xmp theme="united" style="display:none;">

## Changes since version 1.0
- Display a warning of a pending refresh
- Only run on Fox News pages with a comment section
- Show an icon to indicate when active

## How it works
The Fox Reload Blocker works by telling the browser to show a dialog asking if you want
the current page reloaded. Unfortunately, it is not possible to prevent the code running
on the page from requesting a refresh but the refresh can be cancelled with this dialog. 

The dialog is built into the browser so may appear different depending on browser and version.
This is the notice from the present version of Google Chrome. Selecting "Don't Reload" on
this dialog cancels the refresh.

Note that this dialog will come up when you navigate away from the page. In this case indicate
you want the page reloaded. (The prompt should be asking if you if you want the current page 
**unloaded** so a new page can be loaded but the text is baked into the browser).

### Pending Refresh Notification
One downfall of the dialog is that when it comes up any keystrokes you may be making will be
immediately directed to the dialog. So if you are typing a comment and press the space bar 
then that will taken to mean do the default, or reload the page.

Since the refresh on the Fox Forum occurs on an exact 10 minute cycle a warning cab be given
by flashing the page background so you know to stop typing. There are options to control this
in the settings page for the extension. A quick way to get to the page in Chrome listing 
your installed extensions is via the URL `chrome://extensions/`. You can also get to your
installed exensions from the Settings menu.

Once you are in the list of extensions choose the Options link for the extension and you 
will see this dialog:

From here you can:

1) Adjust the refresh interval (in case Fox News changes it)

2) Select how long before the refresh the warning starts

3) Turn off the notification with the checkbox

4) Select how many times and how often the screen is flashed.

5) Control logging

The "Test Settings" button allows you to see how your settings will appear.

The "Save Settings" button saves them when you are satisfied.


### Only run on Fox News pages with a comment section
The intial version of the extension ran on all Fox News pages except the main page. 
Version 1.1 only runs on Fox News pages with comment sections as that's likely the
only place where the refesh is a nuisace.

### Show an icon to indicate when active
Version 1.1 adds a browser notification icon so you can tell when the extension is
active. The icon is active on pages with comment sections. Clicking the icon does
nothing but a context menu is displayed with menu item to get to the settings page.
